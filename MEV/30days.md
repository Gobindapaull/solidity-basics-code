- 30-day learning roadmap

🧠 Week 1: Foundation (Ethereum + Trading + Bots)

📅 Days 1–3: Ethereum Basics

Learn Ethereum architecture (blocks, transactions, gas, mempool).

Study smart contracts (Solidity, EVM).

Tools: Ethereum.org Dev Portal, Remix IDE.

📅 Days 4–5: DEX Mechanics

Understand AMMs (Uniswap v2/v3, Curve).

Learn how swaps work.

Study liquidity pools and slippage.

📅 Days 6–7: Basic Bot Development

Learn how to build bots using ethers.js

Try a simple bot that watches token prices or swaps.

Goal: Monitor a Uniswap pair via WebSocket.

⚙️ Week 2: MEV Concepts + Mempool Access

📅 Days 8–10: MEV Fundamentals

Understand what MEV is: sandwich attacks, arbitrage, liquidation bots.

Read: Flashbots research, MEV explainer articles.

Watch: YouTube videos on frontrunning and backrunning.

📅 Days 11–13: Mempool Monitoring

Learn how to read pending transactions.

Tools: ethers.js WebSocket provider, Flashbots Protect RPC.

Goal: Print live mempool txs for Uniswap trades.

📅 Day 14: Review and Build

Build a bot that monitors mempool swaps with slippage filter.

Log details (tokenIn, tokenOut, amounts, slippage, wallet).

🚀 Week 3: Flashbots + Arbitrage Bot

📅 Days 15–16: Flashbots Basics

Learn how Flashbots bundles work.

Explore mev-share and ethers-flashbots.

📅 Days 17–18: Arbitrage Logic

Learn price discovery across DEXs.

Implement arbitrage opportunity detector between Uniswap and SushiSwap.

📅 Days 19–20: Simulate Arbitrage

Use a forked chain (Hardhat) to simulate arbitrage.

Goal: Execute profit-generating tx locally.

📅 Day 21: Submit via Flashbots

Send simulated bundle via Flashbots relay.

Learn to sign and bundle transactions.

🧠 Week 4: Advanced Strategies + Deployment

📅 Days 22–24: Sandwich Attacks (Educational Only)

Study sandwich attack structure (detect, frontrun, backrun).

Ethics: Never attack real users.

Tools: Mempool filtering, slippage checking.

📅 Days 25–26: Gas Optimization + Reorg Protection

Learn EIP-1559, gas price strategies.

Add nonce protection, gas limits, block delay logic.

📅 Days 27–28: Real-Time Dashboard

Add Telegram/Discord alerts.

Use in-memory stats or SQLite to track profit/loss.

📅 Days 29–30: Review & Launch

Finalize a basic MEV bot (arbitrage or liquidator).

Use Goerli or Sepolia for final testing.

Prepare mainnet deployment (Flashbots relay, private RPC).
